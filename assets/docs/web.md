* Got interest in web development while making Seal Defense, a browser-based
game, but it was far from actual frontend development
  - Built without any web frameworks
* Started web frontend development while making [SNUCSE] \(스누씨\), with React
* Have tried a few web frameworks
  - React
  - Vue
  - Angular 2
* Currently interested in Vue with Nuxt.js
